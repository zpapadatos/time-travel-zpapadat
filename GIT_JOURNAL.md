# Git Journal 

in this lab I have learned a lot on how to manage branches, resolve intentional merge conflicts, and how to use tags. I was able to go in
and fix mistakes that I may have made and debug them to get the correct Git output. I was also able to jump between the command line 
and the git webapp to compete my tasks. One command that helped me was "git log --oneline --graph" and this basically allowed me to see a
graphical representation of your commit history, kind of like the one you see in vscode sometimes.

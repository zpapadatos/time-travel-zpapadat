# Read me file 

I am learning how to use Git an make a magazine in it. I will be acting as an author and an editor in this project.

We will ignore The builds of .class because this will ignore any compiled java class files, as well as .log and this will ignore any log 
files

author/idea-sprint is used by the suthor to create new ideas and possibly new drafts and develop new ideas 
editor/review will be used by the reviewer to see and editor to see any reviews and edits to code that has been done
